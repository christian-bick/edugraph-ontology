*  Noticing that several triangles with the same base and height have the same area and then concluding that all triangles with the same base and height have the same area.
*  Collecting data on the relationship between two variables and using that data to infer a general trend or correlation.

**Science:**

*  Observing that many birds can fly and then concluding that all birds can fly (even though there are exceptions like penguins).
*  Conducting experiments to test a hypothesis and then drawing general conclusions about the natural world based on the results.

**Math:**

*  Observing that a pattern holds for the first few numbers in a sequence and then concluding that the pattern likely holds for all numbers in the sequence (inductive reasoning).
*  Using the properties of known geometric shapes to make an educated guess about the properties of a new, unfamiliar shape (abductive reasoning).
*  Applying the solution strategy from a previously solved problem to a new problem that shares similar features (analogical reasoning).

**Science:**

*  Formulating a scientific hypothesis based on limited observations or data (abductive reasoning).
*  Drawing general conclusions about the behavior of a species based on observations of a sample population (inductive reasoning).
*  Using a model organism, like a mouse, to study a human disease based on the similarities between their biological systems (analogical reasoning).

**Social Science:**

*  Developing a theory about the causes of a social phenomenon based on observed patterns and correlations (inductive reasoning).
*  Formulating a hypothesis about the motivations of historical figures based on limited historical records (abductive reasoning).
*  Using case studies of successful social programs to design similar programs in new contexts (analogical reasoning).""" .
